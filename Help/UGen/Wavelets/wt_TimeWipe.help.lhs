wt_TimeWipe buffer wipe

Zero wavelet coefficients by time position in window.  Passes
particular scales while suppressing (zeroing coefficients) from others


buffer - dwt buffer.

wipe - can range between 0.0 and 1.0. Acts to zero out that proportion
of bins at each scale, starting from the leftmost (earliest in time).
