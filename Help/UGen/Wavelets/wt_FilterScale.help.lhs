wt_FilterScale buffer wipe

Low or high pass filter by wavelet scale.  Passes particular scales
while suppressing (zeroing coefficients) from others.


buffer - dwt buffer.

wipe - can range between -1 and +1. if wipe == 0 then there is no
effect. if wipe > 0 then it acts like a high pass filter, clearing
scales from the bottom up.  if wipe < 0 then it acts like a low pass
filter, clearing scales from the top down.
