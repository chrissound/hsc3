idwt buffer wintype=0 winsize=0 wavelettype=0

The wavelet transform analyzes the input signal with respect to a
mother wavelet at a number of scales. The IDWT UGen returns from the
wavelet coefficient domain to the time domain.

Most often this is used as the end of a process which begins with DWT,
followed by scale-domain processing using WT (wavelet-transform)
UGens, followed by IDWT.

buffer - The dwt chain signal coming originally from an DWT UGen,
perhaps via other WT UGens.

wintype - defines how the data is windowed: -1 is for rectangular
windowing, simple but typically not recommended; 0 (the default) is
for Sine windowing, typically recommended for work when the signal is
reconstructed; 1 is for Hann windowing, typically recommended for
analysis work.

winsize - can be used to account for zero-padding, in the same way as
the DWT UGen.

wavelettype - The choices of wavelet are those available in the gsl
wavelet library code (0-41)

The IDWT UGen converts the DWT data in-place (in the original DWT
buffer) and overlap-adds the result to produce a continuous signal at
its output.
